## What Changed?

The beautiful aurora background (previously only visible on the Landing page) is now displayed **globally across all pages and components** with full light/dark mode support!

## Color Themes

### ðŸŒž Light Mode
The aurora uses **cyan, sky, and blue tones** that create a fresh, modern, professional atmosphere:
- Soft white base with cyan and sky blue gradients
- Gentle animated aurora effects
- Perfect for daytime use

### ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode
The aurora switches to **emerald, mint, and green tones** for a soothing night-time experience:
- Dark gray base with emerald and green gradients
- Subtle animated effects
- Easy on the eyes at night

## How It Works

1. **Global Application**: The aurora is applied once in `App.jsx` as a fixed background layer
2. **Behind Everything**: It sits behind all content (z-index: -10)
3. **Always Visible**: All pages now have transparent backgrounds, allowing the aurora to shine through
4. **Theme Aware**: Uses Tailwind's `dark:` classes to switch colors based on theme

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Navigate** through different pages (login, dashboard, profile, etc.)
2. **Toggle** between light and dark mode using the theme switcher
3. **Notice** how the aurora background is consistently present
4. **Observe** the smooth color transitions when switching themes

## The Aurora Effect Layers

The aurora consists of multiple animated layers that create depth and movement:
- **5 aurora gradient blobs** moving at different speeds
- **1 base gradient** providing the color foundation
- **1 subtle grid overlay** adding texture
- All animations are slow (20-35 seconds) for a calming effect
