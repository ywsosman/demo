# CORS Error Fixed! 🎉

## What Was Wrong

Your frontend is running on **port 5174** but the backend CORS was only allowing **port 5173**.

## What I Fixed

Updated `backend/config.js` and `backend/server.js` to allow both ports:
- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://localhost:5174`

---

## ✅ To Apply the Fix

### Stop and Restart Backend Server:

**In your backend terminal:**
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
2. Run: `npm run dev` to restart

The backend will now accept requests from port 5174!

---

## 🧪 Test Again

After restarting backend:
1. Refresh your browser (F5)
2. Try logging in again
3. CORS errors should be gone! ✅

---

## 📝 For Future Reference

If you see CORS errors:
1. Check which port your frontend is on (look at the URL)
2. Update `backend/config.js` `corsOrigin` to include that port
3. Restart backend server

---

## Alternative: Use Port 5173

If you want to use the default port 5173:
```bash
cd frontend
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart - it should use 5173 if available
npm run dev
```

**Your application should now work perfectly!** 🎊
