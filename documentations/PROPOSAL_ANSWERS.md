## 1. TECHNICAL & AI MODEL QUESTIONS

### 1.1 Model Architecture & Training

**Q: How did you fine-tune the BERT model? What was your training dataset?**

**A:** We fine-tuned a BERT model (BertForSequenceClassification) for multi-class disease classification. The model:
- Uses 12 transformer layers with 768 hidden dimensions
- 12 attention heads per layer
- Maximum sequence length of 512 tokens
- Final classification layer for 41 disease categories
- Training utilized medical symptom-disease paired datasets with patient symptom descriptions

**Q: What metrics did you use to evaluate model accuracy?**

**A:** Our evaluation metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **Precision & Recall**: Per-disease performance
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision/recall
- **Confidence scores**: Model's certainty (0-1 scale)
- We track these metrics per disease class to identify strengths and weaknesses

**Q: Why BERT over other NLP models?**

**A:** BERT was chosen because:
1. **Bidirectional context**: Understands symptoms from both directions
2. **Pre-trained medical knowledge**: Can be fine-tuned on medical data
3. **State-of-the-art NLP**: Proven success in text classification
4. **Transfer learning**: Leverages massive pre-training
5. **Tokenization**: WordPiece handles medical terminology well
6. **Industry standard**: Widely adopted in healthcare AI

**Q: How many diseases can your model predict?**

**A:** The model currently predicts **41 different diseases** including:
- Common conditions (Common Cold, Allergy, Migraine)
- Chronic diseases (Diabetes, Hypertension, Asthma)
- Serious conditions (Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Heart Attack)
- Infectious diseases (Dengue, Malaria, Hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, AIDS)
- And 28 other medical conditions

**Q: What is the accuracy of your model?**

**A:** Based on our testing:
- Confidence scores range from 0-100%
- High-confidence predictions (>80%): Generally accurate
- Medium confidence (60-80%): Require doctor review
- Low confidence (<60%): Multiple possibilities suggested
- Real accuracy depends on symptom description quality

### 1.2 Explainable AI (SHAP)

**Q: Why is explainability important in medical AI?**

**A:** Explainability is critical because:
1. **Trust**: Doctors need to understand AI reasoning
2. **Liability**: Black-box decisions aren't legally defensible
3. **Education**: Helps users learn about their symptoms
4. **Validation**: Doctors can verify if AI focused on correct symptoms
5. **Safety**: Identifies when model might be wrong
6. **Regulatory compliance**: Medical AI must be interpretable

**Q: How does SHAP work technically?**

**A:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):
1. Based on game theory (Shapley values)
2. Calculates each word's contribution to the prediction
3. Creates a baseline prediction (no symptoms)
4. Measures impact of adding each word
5. Assigns positive/negative importance scores
6. Visualizes which symptoms drove the diagnosis

**Implementation in our system:**
```python
# Create SHAP explainer with pipeline
explainer = shap.Explainer(pipeline)

# Generate explanations for symptoms
shap_values = explainer([symptom_text])

# Extract word importance
words = shap_values.data[0]
shap_scores = shap_values.values[0][:, predicted_class_index]
```

**Q: What do SHAP values represent?**

**A:** SHAP values show:
- **Positive values**: Words that increased likelihood of predicted disease
- **Negative values**: Words that decreased likelihood
- **Magnitude**: How much each word contributed
- **Percentage impact**: Normalized contribution (shown as %)

Example: "headache" might have +45% impact on Migraine prediction

**Q: How do you ensure SHAP explanations are clinically meaningful?**

**A:** We ensure meaningfulness by:
1. **Top-10 words**: Show most influential symptoms only
2. **Filter tokens**: Remove [CLS], [SEP], [PAD] special tokens
3. **Color coding**: Red=important, Blue=less relevant
4. **Impact percentages**: Quantify contribution
5. **Human-readable format**: Clear visualizations
6. **Doctor validation**: Doctors can review if AI focused on correct symptoms

### 1.3 Performance & Scalability

**Q: How long does a prediction take?**

**A:** 
- **First prediction**: 20-30 seconds (model loading into memory)
- **Subsequent predictions**: 2-5 seconds (model cached)
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds maximum (failsafe)

**Technical details:**
```javascript
MODEL_TIMEOUT = 60000; // 60 seconds
```

**Q: Can your system handle multiple concurrent users?**

**A:** Current architecture:
- Node.js spawns separate Python processes per request
- Each request is independent (stateless)
- MongoDB handles concurrent writes
- **Limitation**: Each Python instance loads full model (memory intensive)
- **Scalability**: Can deploy multiple backend instances with load balancer
- **Future improvement**: Model server with queuing system

**Q: What happens if the Python model crashes?**

**A:** Comprehensive error handling:
```javascript
pythonProcess.on('error', (error) => {
  resolve({
    success: false,
    error: error.message,
    message: 'Failed to start prediction process'
  });
});
```

- Errors caught gracefully
- User receives friendly error message
- Failed predictions logged for debugging
- System continues operating
- No server crash

**Q: Why Python subprocess instead of REST API?**

**A:** **Trade-offs considered:**

**Subprocess approach (our choice):**
✅ Simpler deployment (single codebase)
✅ No separate model server to manage
✅ Easier development workflow
✅ Lower operational complexity
❌ Higher memory usage (each process loads model)
❌ Slower startup time

**REST API approach:**
✅ Better resource sharing (one model instance)
✅ Faster predictions (model always loaded)
❌ More complex deployment
❌ Two separate services to maintain
❌ Network overhead

**Our justification**: For educational/prototype purposes, subprocess is simpler and meets requirements.

**Q: Resource requirements?**

**A:**
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: ~500MB for model files
- **CPU**: Any modern processor (no GPU required, but supported)
- **Python**: 3.10 or 3.11 (3.13 has compatibility issues)
- **Node.js**: v16 or higher

### 6.2 Quality Assurance

**Q: What happens when model has low confidence?**

**A:** **Low confidence handling:**

1. **Display confidence score**: User sees percentage
2. **Color coding**: Yellow/red for low confidence
3. **Multiple predictions**: Top-3 alternatives shown
4. **Stronger disclaimer**: "Please consult healthcare professional"
5. **Doctor review**: All cases reviewed anyway
6. **SHAP analysis**: Show why model uncertain

**Threshold levels:**
```javascript
if (confidence >= 0.8) return 'green' // High
if (confidence >= 0.6) return 'yellow' // Medium
return 'red' // Low confidence
```

**Q: Do you have a minimum confidence threshold?**

**A:** **Current approach:**

- **No hard threshold**: All predictions shown
- **Reasoning**: Doctor reviews all cases anyway
- **User informed**: Confidence score displayed

**Alternative approach:**
```javascript
confidenceThreshold: 0.1  // Config setting
```

- Could reject predictions below threshold
- Show "Unable to determine" message
