## 🎨 User Experience

### Before (Rule-Based AI):
- Simple keyword matching
- Basic predictions
- No explanation
- Low confidence
- Black box decision

### After (BERT + SHAP):
- Advanced NLP model
- Accurate predictions
- **Visual word importance** ⭐
- High confidence
- Transparent AI

### Example Output:
```
Prediction: Migraine (89% confidence)

Key Words Contributing:
• "severe" → 45.23% impact
• "headache" → 38.14% impact
• "nausea" → 32.07% impact
• "sensitivity" → 28.91% impact
• "light" → 25.33% impact
```
